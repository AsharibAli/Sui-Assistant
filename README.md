## Project Overview

**SuiGPT** is a highly trained assistant that provides in-depth insights about the Sui Blockchain and its ecosystem projects. It answers queries with precision, making complex Sui topics accessible to **newcomers, researchers, enthusiasts, and developers.** <br>

SuiGPT assists developers in building dapps on the Sui Blockchain using the Move Programming Language for smart contract development through a conversational UI, powered by **OpenAI Assistants and the GPT-4o model.** <br>

It helps developers code, fix, and test their smart contracts written in Move to build web3 applications on Sui. Simply enter a prompt in the UI to get accurate answers. Specially designed for the Sui community of developers and ecosystem projects, SuiGPT was developed by Asharib Ali as a submission for the **"Sui Overflow Hackathon"** <br>

**SuiGPT** offers many great features to help developers build and ship quickly on **Sui Blockchain.** <br>

## Problem Statement with Solution

Developers want to build on Sui but lack an interactive way to quickly and easily create full-stack web3 applications. They might use ChatGPT, but it's trained on outdated data and doesn't know about the latest developments. Plus, GPT Plus costs $20 per month. That's why we need a platform/chatbot to address this issue: "Help developers write, fix, and test their smart contracts in Move for the Sui Blockchain" in a conversational way. I have trained it on a massive amount of Sui Codebase & Ecosystem projects data for building on Sui and have prompt-engineered it to achieve the best results.

## Tech Stack
